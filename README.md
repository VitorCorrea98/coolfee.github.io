# Welcome to the jungle!
### We treat the stranger who stay with us as the native among.

Coolfee is a user-friendly web application designed to enhance your JavaScript learning experience. Our platform offers a seamless environment where you can effortlessly create and test your code.

For educators, the "Tests" tab enables you to create comprehensive assessments. Simply fill in the necessary information or leave certain fields blank in the "Code" tab, and effortlessly share the assignments with your students. Our test language is based on Jest, but it's a much simpler version with a lot less matchers.

If you're a student, Coolfee serves as a dynamic playground for you to explore and master JavaScript. Challenge yourself by attempting the tests curated by your teacher and elevate your coding skills in a fun and interactive manner.
